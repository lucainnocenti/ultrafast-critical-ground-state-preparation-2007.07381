- `./lz_optimizations.ipynb`
    Optimizations to reach the groudn state at the avoided crossing of the LZ.
    Contains optimizations with double-bang and CRAB protocols, as well as relative figures used in the paper.
- `./lmg_20spins_optimizations.ipynb`, `./lmg_50spins_optimizations.ipynb`
    Optimizations double-bang vs CRAB for LMG with 20 and 50 spins.
    The 50 spins notebook also contains optimisations for different energy bounds.
- `./lmg_results_analysis.ipynb`
    Old notebook. Contains code to visualise the protocols corresponding to optimisation results.
