This data is flawed:

	1) There was a problem in the way the discontinuity of bangramp and doublebang was implemented. Instead of an actual abrupt change, the protocol was implemented via linear interpolating between (t1, y0) and (t1 * 1.01, y1), which generates spurious results when the intermediate time is set very close to the end of the protocol and the change in parameter is big.
	2) The CRAB results are actually all with only two frequencies, and moreover the actual frequencies were not saved to file.
